# Prosecution Workflow

The **Prosecution** module tracks the judicial phase of a case, from filing charges to final case outcomes.

## Filing Charges
To formally charge a suspect:
1. Navigate to the **Prosecution** tab.
2. Click **File Charge**.
3. **Select Statute**: e.g., *Cybercrimes (Prohibition, Prevention, etc.) Act 2015*.
4. **Select Section**: Choose the specific section of the law (e.g., *Section 22 - Identity Theft*).
    *   *The system will automatically display the legal description of the selected section.*
5. **Status**: Set initial status (usually **Filed**).
6. **Description**: Specific details of the count/charge.
7. Click **File Charge**.

## Tracking Court Sessions
Keep a calendar of all legal proceedings.

1. In the Prosecution tab, find the **Court Sessions** panel.
2. Click **Schedule Session**.
3. Enter details:
    *   **Date & Time**: When the hearing is scheduled.
    *   **Court**: e.g., *Federal High Court, Abuja*.
    *   **Judge**: Presiding judge details.
    *   **Type**: Arraignment, Hearing, Trial, Ruling, etc.
4. Future sessions appear in the scheduler; past sessions form a court log.

## Recording Outcomes
When a case concludes, record the formal legal disposition.

1. Locate the **Case Outcome** panel.
2. Click **Record Outcome**.
3. **Disposition**:
    *   **Convicted**: Found guilty.
    *   **Acquitted**: Found not guilty.
    *   **Plea Bargain**: Negotiated settlement.
    *   **Dismissed**: Case dropped.
4. **Sentence**: Terms of imprisonment or punishment (e.g., *"5 years imprisonment"*).
5. **Restitution**: Monetary compensation ordered (in Naira).
6. **Closed At**: Date of judgment.

Recording an outcome helps in generating final case statistics and reports.
