# Intelligence Module

The **Intelligence Dashboard** allows investigators to monitor, analyze, and manage intelligence reports separate from formal criminal cases. This module is designed for gathering actionable intel that may later ripen into full investigations.

## Dashboard Overview

*   **Total Intelligence**: Count of all intelligence reports filed.
*   **Critical Priority**: Intel flagged as urgent or high-risk.
*   **Actionable Intel**: Confirmed intelligence ready for operational use.
*   **Recent Activity**: The velocity of new intel coming in.

## Features
