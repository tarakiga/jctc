# Dashboard

The **Dashboard** is your command center in JCTC. Upon logging in, you are greeted with a high-level overview of your investigative operations, critical alerts, and team activity.

## Key Metrics
The top of the dashboard displays four real-time metric cards:

*   **Total Cases**: The cumulative number of cases across all departments.
*   **Active (Under Investigation)**: Cases currently open and requiring attention.
*   **Critical Cases**: High-priority investigations flagged as "Severity 5".
*   **Recent Activity**: New cases submitted or updated in the current month.

## Team Activity Calendar
A visual calendar heatmap tracks team engagement and workload.
*   **Darker cells** indicate higher activity (more logs, updates, or movements).
*   Hover over a date to see the specific count of actions taken by the team.

## Recent Cases
A quick-access list of the 5 most recently updated cases.
*   Displays **Case Number**, **Title**, and **Severity**.
*   Clicking any row navigates directly to that case's detail view.

## System status
*   **Greeting**: Personalized welcome message based on the time of day.
*   **Date**: Current date display.

The dashboard automatically refreshes to ensure you always have the latest operational data.
